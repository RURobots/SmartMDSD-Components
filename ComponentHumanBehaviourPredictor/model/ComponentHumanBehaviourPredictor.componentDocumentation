	HardwareRequirements : "None"
	
	Purpose :
	"Component that predicts the future space occupied by nearby humans based on 
	human "skeleton" data"
	
	Description : "The Human Behaviour Predictor components receive skeleton data (via 
	push notifications) from a Skeleton Tracker components. From this data the movement of 
	the skeletons can be extrapolated to determine the extent of the space occupied by the 
	human over a specified period of time. 
	
	In the case of this more sophisticated variant of the human behaviour predictor, the
	predictions are based on the velocities of motion of each of the joint applied using
	knowledge of the kinematics and joint limits of the human arm.
	
	The output from this component is sent on request via a client/server port and is in 
	the form of the maximum and minimum extents of an occupancy region described in the 
	specified reference frame."
	
	Dependencies : "
	CommBasicObjects, 
	DomainHumanTracking,
 	"
	
	Installation :
	"The contents of this directory can be copied into the required location in the 
	SmartMDSD workspace and then the component can be imported using the "Import->
	File System" command from the SmartMDSD Project Explorer when in the Component
	Perspective.
