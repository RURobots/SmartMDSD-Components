	License : "LGPL (some libraries have more restrictive licences)"
	
	HardwareRequirements : "None"
	
	Purpose :
	"Component that determines the joint positions (the "skeleton") of any human	
	bodies seen within a pair of rgb and depth images"
	
	Description :
	"The Human Skeleton Tracker components receives a CommRGBDImage 3D image data
	structure via a push service from a 3D sensor component such as the Kinect Server V2
	components or the RealSense V2 Server component.  It then determines a skeleton
	model (the position of joint nodes and the links between them) of of any humans with 
	their field of view.
	
	It outputs the resulting skeletons simultaneously via both a push service and a query 
	service for maximum flexibility.
	
	The relevant specification for the input ports are contained within DomainVision 
	which is provided as part of the RobMoSys ecosystem.  The specification for the output
	ports is provided within the DomainHumanTracking domain.
	
	Several piece of configuration data are required for the correct operation of this
	component.
	
	The config.score_threshold parameter is used to specify the dection score that
	causes a joint to be specified as "tracked".  A score below this level causes the 
	joint to be specified as "inferred".
	
	There are also configuration parameters to turn on and off debug information printing
	and the	display of the input images.
	
	The configuration data includes a float that is used to specify a threshold	value for
	the joint position confidence.  Joint positions that are detected but have a 
	lower confidence value than this threshold are given an "inferred" status in the 
	output data.  Values are also specified for the maximum and minimum expected ranges
	and the maximum joint velocity.  These values are used to filter out erroneous pose
	estimates.  A configuration parameter is also used to specify the location of the
	training model data in the file syste,  It is very important that this is given the
	correct value."
	
	Dependencies : "
	CommBasicObjects, 
	DomainHumanTracking,
	DomainVision,
	openpose (and all its dependencies.  Note the commercial use licence restrictions),
	opencv (and all its dependencies)
	"
	
	Installation :
	"The contents of this directory can be copied into the required location in the 
	SmartMDSD workspace and then the component can be imported using the "Import->
	File System" command from the SmartMDSD Project Explorer when in the Component
	Perspective.

	This component also requires that the openpose library and training data
	(note the commercial use licence restrictions) must also be downloaded and
	installed using the instructions at the following url: https://github.com/CMU-
	Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/find/master.

	The instructions for installing the C++ API must be followed.  This installation will
	require that OpenCV is also installed.
	
	To ensure that the performance of the software is fast enough, ensure that all
	possible acceleration options are enabled for the graphics card that is in use,
	i.e. openGL, cuda or openCL."
